 NOTE: Please use the Master branch. The Httpeapod branch is a unstable experiment to mix up httpebble with Peapod+,
 but things are still under heavy developement, and might never see the light cause of some technical limitaions!!
 

Experiment on Katherin's Peapod :)

This app adds some more 2 way communication functionality with Katharine's Peapod app. The original Peapod app is
used to better music control, and now PeapodPlus has NotesViewer, Calendar view+RecentReminder+CalenderEvents, 
BatteryStatus+FindMyPhone+VolumeControl, CameraControl with Flash and Camera selection options. Here is some 
specifications...

* Peapod: Katharine's lovely music control app with album art, volume control and Library browsing.
* Notes: Supports 5 notes with 15charactesr title and 699 characters of each NoteText Length.
* Calendar: Shows normal calendar, up down goes to next previous month. Tapping the select button shows upcoming 7-10 
  calendar events and reminders together sorted by date, long press will return the calendar to current month.
* Phone Status: Shows batter percentage (not always accurate), battery status (charging/using/charged). You can 
  control phone volume using up/down key, and play a sound with Ping my Phone pressing the select button.
* Camera Control: Up key switches the Front/Rear camera, down key switch the flash to auto/on/off mode and the select
  button, obviously takes a shot. (For using this option your phone app need to be in foreground/open, NOT in background)
